## Setup commands
- Install hatch: see https://hatch.pypa.io/1.13/install/

## Code style
- Use `hatch fmt` to format code.
- Assume the reader is an expert Python programmer and omit obvious comments.
- Please examine previous git commit messages and use a similar style. E.g., "Adds foo feature."
- Use type annotations wherever possible
